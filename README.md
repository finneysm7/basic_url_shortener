This is a url shortener that I made in a weekend. It is a simple rails app.

In order to run this url shortner, copy the repository and ensure that ruby and rails are both installed onto your computer. After running rails server from the directory, you should be able to view the application and shorten urls from localhost:3000.

The production version of this url shortener can be viewed [here](https://obscure-stream-6430.herokuapp.com/).
